# struBIC These codes aim to find the structure of  conditional independence between random variables with normal distribuiton. It combines a new model selection criterion 
structural BIC with a novel model pool construciton algorithm (two-step algorithm). For details, see https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/815423v1.
